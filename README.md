# pcb-gcode-postprocessor
This python script has the only purpose of get rid of some Gcode I find useless:

1. **Comments**. I use Candle as my GUI for controlling my CNC machine which has **grbl** in it. Grbl doesn't play nice with comments in the code and Candle stops the execution of everything when grbl throws an error. This is aweful.
1. **Homing when finishing Etching** I would like the machine go Home (G0 X0 Y0) when it finishes etching.
1. **Only one Tool Size for drilling** I found the pcb-gcode hard to config when I only have one Tool size for drills. I prefer to post process the drill file to delete all the code placed for Tool change since I have only one size of drill.

# How to run
1. Just place this python file in the same directory where your files were generated by pcb-gcode (the .etch.tap and .drill-tap files).
1. Run with `python pcb-gcode-postprocessor.py`
1. Wait for the program to finish (should not take more than a second or two)
1. You are ready to etch and drill those PCB's
